\section{Spacecraft Modes of Operation}
The spacecraft will experience the following modes during its lifetime. A different configuration of system operations and instructions will be executed by \textit{SnapSat} in each case. These are summarised in table~\ref{tab:modesofoperation} below.

            \textbf{Spacecraft Mode} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline\hline
            Safe mode & (NOTE: this is example text) This mode is intended to keep the satellite alive. Only the essential components are ON all the time - such as the OBC, power board and VHF receiver. Transmitter is turned ON occasionally. 
            Has uncontrolled attitude. 
             \\\hline
            Recovery/De-tumble mode & (NOTE: this is example text) This mode is used to de-tumble the spacecraft after ejection from the deployment dispenser as well as to recover it from any spin-ups. In addition to the essential components that are ON all the time, the ADCS is also operational during this mode. Any other device could be turned ON by ground command.  \\\hline
